# Assignment-4

The game ”Des Chiffres et Des Lettres” is a popular intellectual television game in France
that has been adapted in other countries under different names. The game requires
mathematical skills, linguistic skills, and also some strategic thinking. In this assignment,
we are going to implement a training platform to prepare contestant play this game on
TV.
Game rules
Each game consists of two rounds:
• Letters round
• Numbers round
Letters round
The player is given a set of letters one by one. At each step, the player is asked whether
a vowel or a consonant should be provided and the computer generates a random letter
corresponding to the player’s choice.
The player will, then, have to use these letters to create the longest valid word. The
player must provide his word within a limited amount of time. But this time constraint
is waived in this assignment.
Numbers round
Players are given a set of six numbers, typically consisting of small numbers (1-10) and
large numbers from the list (25, 50, 75, 100).
A three-digit target number is randomly generated. Players must use any combination of
the random numbers and basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, //) to reach the target
number. The closest guess to the target number using valid operations wins.
